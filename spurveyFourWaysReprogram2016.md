There are two main ways to change as a person:

1. Experiencing a significant life event that affects us deeply at an emotional
   level
   - This change is typically immediate.
2. Proactively choosing to change, working on ourselves consistently and making
   use of _spaced repetition_.
   - This change is more gradual.
   - We are in charge of this change.

The author defines spaced repetition as the methodical sending of messages from
the conscious mind to the subconscious mind, until we are coerced into believing
new things about ourselves. (side-note: sounds like self-brainwashing -- not
necessarily a bad thing I suppose).

## The 4 Ways of Reprogramming your Subconscious mind

### 1. Vision

The author defines a _vision_ as a moment or day in an idealized life when you
are doing, being and having your best: the way you would like to live.

The approach here is to outline a vision in the present tense, incorporating as
many senses as possible. To put the vision to work, it is then essential to read
it daily (daily!! Sounds to me like this guy is missing the point of spaced
repetition? s-p-a-c-e-d. Daily seems suffocating.), in a relaxed setting.

### 2. Auto-suggestion

Here the author suggests to engage in _positive_ self-talk. Repeat positive
affirmations about yourself to yourself. These are short statements about
yourself that you would like to embrace.

### 3. Gratitude

The author has found that the best way to manipulate one's attitude is by
practicing gratitude, i.e. reflecting on what you are grateful for. The author
suggests doing this at the start and end of your day.

### 4. Journaling

The author suggests using a journal to keep track of your visions, affirmations
and gratitude practices, and to turn them into habits.

## Final comment by Me

I think there is some value in this article, but I don't think the author is
using the term _spaced repetition_ correctly, or at least following the
[pre-existing definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition). If
anything though, this has made me curious about approaching the techniques he
presents using actual spaced repetition, perhaps similarly to what
[Nick Cammarata tweeted about a while ago](https://twitter.com/nickcammarata/status/1315129231102234625).
