Optical Turbulence is a small-scale phenomenon wherein incoming wavefronts from
distant stars are perturbed when passing through our atmosphere due to
fluctuations in the index of refraction of the air.

The effect is a decreased resolution in the observations, quantified by the
metric known as seeing, the apparent angular diameter of a point source.

The fluctuations in the index of refraction of the air are caused by wind shear
and the thermally stable stratification of the atmosphere.

The most intense OT is typically at sea level, followed by the second most
intense OT near the jet-stream. 

Optical Turbulence can be tackled via the use of adaptive optics
