# SÃ¶nke Ahrens - How To Take Smart Notes - 2017

- On page 26: Everything you need to do:
  1. Take Fleeting Notes
      - non permanent notes taken whenever you have an idea or thought, with no worries 
      - should be 'processed' (see permanent notes) ASAP, within a day ideally.
  2. Take Literature Notes
      - Take notes whenever you read, on a separate medium 
      - use your own words and keep it short
  3. Make permanent notes
      - Look at Fleeting and Literature Notes and reflect:
          - how do they relate to your current interests? Search for connections and insights
      - One note per idea (atomicity)
      - Once done:
          - dispose Fleeting Notes
          - Organize Literature Notes in a Reference System (eg Zotero)
  4. Add Permanent Notes to Slip Box
      - Add links when possible
      - Use index notes (notes that link sets of notes)

- On Page 36: Writing is the only thing that matters:
    - Pretend that if you don't write it down (in your own words), it doesn't count
        - this is in fact almost the matter of things because
            - it forces you to think about it.
            - it gives you a purpose as to why you're reading/listening
                - hence sharpening focus 
        - living by this truth will force you to:
            - learn how to discern good arguments from good sounding arguments, since you'll
              have to decide which ones to write down
            - learn efficiently, to reach the phase of 'open questions' more quickly
            - retain information by reflecting on how to synthesize it in your own words.
