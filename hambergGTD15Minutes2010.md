# Erlend Hamberg - GTD in 15 minutes â€“ A Pragmatic Guide to Getting Things Done - 2010

GTD ("Getting Things Done") is a system for organizing pending _tasks_ by writing
them down in 5 specific _lists_, linked to a _calendar_ for time-sensitive tasks.

This is to free your subconscious of these tasks, allowing it space to think
about more important ideas.

The 5 lists are:

1. in
2. next actions
3. waiting for
4. projects
5. some day/maybe

## The "In" List

This is the list where you should place any task-like idea as soon as it comes to you.
It doesn't have to be a single list, there can be multiple. The important thing
is that it is extremely easy to write these tasks down at any moment.

### Processing the "In" List

Follow these steps

1. Go through the items in the list, in the order in which they were added
2. Ask yourself whether the task _needs_ you to do something about it
   - If not, either:
     - eliminate the task
     - keep it as reference material
     - incubate it by adding it to your calendar or ticker file (explained
       later)
   - If you _need_ to do something about it (it is _actionable_):
     - write down what the next _physical_ action should be.
       - a physical action is one you can do at any moment.
     - If you can do it in less than 2 minutes do it right away
     - Otherwise either
       - delegate it to the _waiting for_ list
       - add it to a _next actions_ list, for collecting actions you aim to do
         as soon as you have the time and energy.

## The "next actions" list

This is simply a list of actions that you should take as soon as possible.

### Context

A next action's context is essentially one or more tags that describe where and/or with what equipment a next action can be achieved. The point of this is to allow you to determine at a glance what you can do given the physical context you find yourself in.

## The "waiting for" list

This is a list of things that are currently blocked, pending on some third
party to act. Mark them with date.

## The "projects" list

Any objective that requires more than one action for completion should be
listed here with a title and optionally a description. You should ensure that
there is always one action in the next actions list for each project.

## The "some day/maybe" list

This is a list for where we collect projects and tasks that don't _need_ to be
done and are simply things you _might_ want to do at some point in the future.

## The Calendar

This is for collecting tasks that absolutely need to be done at a specific date
and time, and nothing more.

## Weekly Review

Do this once per week. Takes a while, so set some time specifically for doing
it. Do the following:

- Ensure each project has at least one next action associated with it
- Ensure each next action is actually something you need/want to do
  - if not, move it to maybe list.
  - or remove it completely if you think you'll never do it.
- Go through someday/maybe list and see if you think you should move some
  actions/projects to the projects/next actions lists.
- Ensure newly created projects are associated with a next action.

### Trigger List

It may be useful to utilize a trigger list. This is a list of keywords that may
remind you of open loops that you have yet to capture in the system. If the
trigger list works in triggering something, add it to the "in" list, to be
processed soon afterwards.

## Some Notes

- Ensure there are hard boundaries between lists.
- **read/review folder**: for collecting the actual files you want to read and
  have marked as "read [file]" in your next actions list.
