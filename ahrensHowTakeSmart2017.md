# SÃ¶nke Ahrens - How To Take Smart Notes - 2017

## 2 - Everything you need to do:

1. Take Fleeting Notes
   - non permanent notes taken whenever you have an idea or thought, with no worries
   - should be 'processed' (see permanent notes) ASAP, within a day ideally.
2. Take Literature Notes
   - Take notes whenever you read, on a separate medium
   - use your own words and keep it short
3. Make permanent notes
   - Look at Fleeting and Literature Notes and reflect:
     - how do they relate to your current interests? Search for connections and insights
   - One note per idea (atomicity)
   - Once done:
     - dispose Fleeting Notes
     - Organize Literature Notes in a Reference System (eg Zotero)
4. Add Permanent Notes to Slip Box
   - Add links when possible
   - Use index notes (notes that link sets of notes)

## 5 - Writing is the only thing that matters:

- Pretend that if you don't write it down (in your own words), it doesn't count
  - this is in fact almost the matter of things because
    - it forces you to think about it.
    - it gives you a purpose as to why you're reading/listening
      - hence sharpening focus
  - living by this truth will force you to:
    - learn how to discern good arguments from good sounding arguments, since you'll
      have to decide which ones to write down
    - learn efficiently, to reach the phase of 'open questions' more quickly
    - retain information by reflecting on how to synthesize it in your own words.

## 8 - Let the Work Carry You Forward

- We are hoping to achieve a dynamic in our workflow that energizes us and
  keeps us engaged. This allows us to be productive with little effort.
  - This can be achieved by ensuring that our workflow follows a _positive
    feedback_ loop, wherein we feel rewarded by the work we do, causing us to
    _want_ to do more of it, since we enjoy it.
- Positive feedback motivates us because it communicates that we are getting
  better.
- To get positive feedback though, we need to be open to feedback in general,
  the 'growth mindset'
  - This is because without negative feedback, we won't know what to improve
    on, and won't improve on it.
- The system described in this book is designed on purpose so to regularly
- provide small, high quality feedback:
  - Forcing yourself to write while you read gives you feedback on your
    understanding
  - Making permanent notes from your inbox gives you feedback on your writing
  - Making connections to existing permanent notes gives you feedback on gaps
    in your thinking, and your writing.

## 9 - Separate and Interlocking Tasks

- Writing requires focused, sustained attention, which is a limited resource
  - Multitasking sucks
    - It has been shown to reduce productivity, by reducing the quality and
      quantity of your accomplishments.
      - When you 'multitask', what you are really doing is constantly shifting
        your attention between multiple tasks, requiring extra effort, and
        essentially interrupting any attempt at _focused attention_
    - Writing is a multi-faceted process with several required tasks (e.g.
      reading, thinking, gathering insight, typing, editing, etc.)
  - Writing requires a wide gamut of types of attention. From focused, to
    exploratory, floating. This is the case for any sort of creative or scientific pursuit.
    - To be able to achieve such flexibility, one needs a flexible system that
      doesn't rely on plans or structure, such as the zettelkasten.
    - Instead, the zettelkasten provides a framework wherein through repeated
      experience, you build expertise and hence intuition to guide you.
- Like attention, our short-term memory is also limited. We can hold a maximum
  of 7 +/- 2 things in our head at the same time.
  - We can "hack" our short-term memory by bundling the "things" we need to
    remember. In a way, bundling is just another word for applying a rule,
    like remembering a formula rather than the outputs of the formula.
    - This is why it is easier to remember things that we _understand_.
      - These are things that are internally connected in our brain.
  - We can also "hack" our short-term memory by making use of the _Zeigarnik
    Effect_:
    - Open tasks occupy our short-term memory until they are done _OR_
      until they are written down in a way that convinces us that they will be
      taken care of.
    - Writing off less-important tasks/ideas for later gives space in our brain
      to focus and ruminate on more complex tasks.
      - Doing so may allow us to come up with solutions "by accident".
    - This is why thinking in writing, the principle of zettelkasten is so
      great: everything is externalized anyway, freeing your mind to focus on the
      important.
- Willpower is also a limited resource that is necessary for successful
  writing.
  - We can cheat ourselves into gaining willpower by reducing the number of decisions we
    have to make
    - This is because decision-making is one of the most tiring tasks we carry
      out throughout the day.
    - Deciding on a organizational system such as the zettelkasten allows us to
      decrease the number of decisions to make.
- Breaks are important for the brain because they allow the brain to process
  information, either by removing it or moving it into long-term memory so to
  free up space for new information in our short-term memory buffer.

## 10 - Read for Understanding

### 10.1 - Read With a Pen in Hand

- We should read with the intention to link what we read into our slipbox later.
- As such we should always take notes while reading, and these notes should be
  translations of the main ideas of the text into our own words and idea
  contexts.
- Handwriting literature notes instead of typing them may help understanding
  - this is because it is _slower_, and hence the note-taker is forced to
    synthesize what they have read/heard in their mind before writing it
    down.

### 10.2 - Keep an Open Mind

- Be wary of _Confirmation Bias_. Unfortunately we automatically gravitate
  towards what we like, anything that confirms what we already believe. This
  is the perfect recipe for falling into confirmation bias.
- The zettelkasten method tackles confirmation bias in 2 ways:
  1.  ideas are developed bottom-up, meaning there is no opportunity to
      discriminate against ideas you don't agree with, since you're collecting
      everything that connects or is open to connection within our slip-box.
  2.  Because we are optimizing for relevancy, we actively seek de-confirming
      facts.

### 10.3 - Get the Gist

- By taking notes anytime we read something, we practice getting the gist of
  things, as we want to get the most from the least amount of effort
- By practising this, we get better at it.

### 10.4 - Learn to Read

- The more familiar we are with something, the more likely we are to like it
  and to believe we understand it. Familiarity != understanding, however.
- Merely reading can fool you into believing you understand the text via the
  _mere exposure_ effect
- Instead, we should find a way to _test_ our understanding.
  - A perfect test for this is attempting to explain what we have just read, in
    our own words. This is why we should take (rephrased) notes on what we
    read, while/soon after we read it.
- Following this, we find that rereading text is also useless, if we don't
  accompany the rereading with external tests, such as explaining what we're
  reading in our own words.

### 10.5 - Learn by Reading

- To learn, we need to actively search for old knowledge in our brain and find
  a way to connect it to the incoming understanding. This requires effort.
- Physical exercise helps to
  - transfer knowledge to our long-term memory
  - reduce stress, hence reducing hormones that hamper learning in the brain.
- The most successful learning method is _elaboration_
  - This is similar to our zettelkasten method and boils down to _thinking_
    about the meaning of what we are reading/listening to:
    - how does it answer different questions?
    - how can it be connected to other knowledge?

## 11 - Take Smart Notes

- Experienced readers and successful people read a text and think about how it
  fits into a bigger picture, an external world.
  - The text to them is not self contained and is not the be-all end-all on the topic.
  - They approach the text with questions of their own and compare it to competing approaches.
  - In a way, they remain sceptical, and are able to spot the limitations and
    see what it fails to mention.

### 11.2 - Think Outside the Brain

- At page 89 there's a good example of how to go about adding a permanent note
  to the zettelkasten. (Very important, go see)

### 11.3 - Learn by not Trying

- There's a theory that forgetting is not loss of memory, but simply the
  unconscious suppression of seemingly unimportant memories, which stay
  stored in the back of our minds.
- This is useful, because remembering everything would mean being bombarded by
  noise of irrelevant and unnecessary memories, making it difficult to focus
  on what the gist, the more important stuff, is.
- As such, remembering is simply the process of finding a stored memory. And
  learning is the process of ensuring that the right cues trigger the right
  memory, by ensuring that the right connections exist between topics in our
  brain.
- The most effective learning is hence not optimizing storage space, but
  instead optimizing the quantity and quality of meaningful connections to
  a wide variety of contexts for a given piece of information.
- This way of learning fosters _understanding_
- Too much order hampers learning. This is why the zettelkasten is built
  bottom-up, with the possibility of adding connections between heterogeneous
  clusters of notes.

### 11.4 - Adding Permanent Notes to the Slip-Box

First we write the notes, then we have to worry about adding them to the
Zettelkasten:

1. If working with a physical zettelkasten, place the note behind the most
   recent note or behind the note it directly refers to if it does.
2. Add links to the note, and links in the note to other notes.
3. Ensure the note can be found from the index.
4. Focus on building a network of knowledge in your mind as you skim through
   the zettelkasten.

## 12 - Develop Ideas

- Don't worry about writing complete notes: only write what helps thinking.
- structure emerges from the network clusters that form naturally when adding
  references between notes. This is why references are so important.

### 12.1 - Develop Topics

- We use indexes as lists of entry points (links to notes with further links)
  to the knowledge-base. We shouldn't worry about the index too much, and
  accept that a complete overview of the zettelkasten is impossible, and the
  wrong way to think about it anyway.
- These entry points should be links to notes providing an ever-changing
  overview of a specific topic - a structure note.
  - If this structure becomes outdated, we can make a new note and replace the
    link in the index.
- When adding tags, ensure these are context-specific, and chosen with an eye
  towards the topics you are currently interested in. Tags should aid you in
  _retrieval_, not archival. See page 102.

### 12.2 - Make Smart Connections

- There are 2 main types of connections:
  - Connections to notes from an index or from a structure note.
  - Direct note-to-note connections.1
- When searching for connections to add to a new note, we need to literally go
  through the zettelkasten looking for these connections. Doing this
  literally rather than in your head makes you more likely to find real
  connections instead of forcing them.

## 13 - Share Your Insight

### 13.2 - From Top Down to Bottom Up

- The more confident we are with previously encountered ideas and knowledge,
  the more open we become to new ideas
  - This is because we are comfortable with being playful with the original
    ideas, and are flexible enough to think about their shortcomings.

## 14 - Make It a Habit

- Good intentions are not enough for the long-run.
- We should accept the reality that deep behavioural change is very difficult
  to achieve.
- What we need instead is to develop habits and routines strategically.
  - This means building habits step-by-step, in such a way that each step leads
    to the next.

## Afterword

- The tunnel effect: we tend to stick to familiar routines when under stress,
  even when these routines caused the issues in the first place
- Read with a pen in your hand, make permanent notes from what you read and
  think and make connections between these permanent notes
