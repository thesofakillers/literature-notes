# SÃ¶nke Ahrens - How To Take Smart Notes - 2017

## Chapter 2 - Everything you need to do:

1. Take Fleeting Notes
   - non permanent notes taken whenever you have an idea or thought, with no worries
   - should be 'processed' (see permanent notes) ASAP, within a day ideally.
2. Take Literature Notes
   - Take notes whenever you read, on a separate medium
   - use your own words and keep it short
3. Make permanent notes
   - Look at Fleeting and Literature Notes and reflect:
     - how do they relate to your current interests? Search for connections and insights
   - One note per idea (atomicity)
   - Once done:
     - dispose Fleeting Notes
     - Organize Literature Notes in a Reference System (eg Zotero)
4. Add Permanent Notes to Slip Box
   - Add links when possible
   - Use index notes (notes that link sets of notes)

## Chapter 5 - Writing is the only thing that matters:

- Pretend that if you don't write it down (in your own words), it doesn't count
  - this is in fact almost the matter of things because
    - it forces you to think about it.
    - it gives you a purpose as to why you're reading/listening
      - hence sharpening focus
  - living by this truth will force you to:
    - learn how to discern good arguments from good sounding arguments, since you'll
      have to decide which ones to write down
    - learn efficiently, to reach the phase of 'open questions' more quickly
    - retain information by reflecting on how to synthesize it in your own words.

## Chapter 8 - Let the Work Carry You Forward

- We are hoping to achieve a dynamic in our workflow that energizes us and
  keeps us engaged. This allows us to be productive with little effort.
  - This can be achieved by ensuring that our workflow follows a _positive
    feedback_ loop, wherein we feel rewarded by the work we do, causing us to
    _want_ to do more of it, since we enjoy it.
- Positive feedback motivates us because it communicates that we are getting
  better.
- To get positive feedback though, we need to be open to feedback in general,
  the 'growth mindset'
  - This is because without negative feedback, we won't know what to improve
    on, and won't improve on it.
- The system described in this book is designed on purpose so to regularly
- provide small, high quality feedback:
  - Forcing yourself to write while you read gives you feedback on your
    understanding
  - Making permanent notes from your inbox gives you feedback on your writing
  - Making connections to existing permanent notes gives you feedback on gaps
    in your thinking, and your writing.

## Chapter 9 - Separate and Interlocking Tasks

- Writing requires focused, sustained attention
- Multitasking sucks
  - It has been shown to reduce productivity, by reducing the quality and
    quantity of your accomplishments.
    - When you 'multitask', what you are really doing is constantly shifting
      your attention between multiple tasks, requiring extra effort, and
      essentially interrupting any attempt at _focused attention_
  - Writing is a multi-faceted process with several required tasks (e.g.
    reading, thinking, gathering insight, typing, editing, etc.)
- Writing requires a wide gamut of types of attention. From focused, to
  exploratory, floating. This is the case for any sort of creative or scientific pursuit.
- To be able to achieve such flexibility, one needs a flexible system that
  doesn't rely on plans or structure, such as the zettelkasten.
