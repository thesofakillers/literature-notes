# SÃ¶nke Ahrens - How To Take Smart Notes - 2017

## Chapter 2 - Everything you need to do:

1. Take Fleeting Notes
   - non permanent notes taken whenever you have an idea or thought, with no worries
   - should be 'processed' (see permanent notes) ASAP, within a day ideally.
2. Take Literature Notes
   - Take notes whenever you read, on a separate medium
   - use your own words and keep it short
3. Make permanent notes
   - Look at Fleeting and Literature Notes and reflect:
     - how do they relate to your current interests? Search for connections and insights
   - One note per idea (atomicity)
   - Once done:
     - dispose Fleeting Notes
     - Organize Literature Notes in a Reference System (eg Zotero)
4. Add Permanent Notes to Slip Box
   - Add links when possible
   - Use index notes (notes that link sets of notes)

## Chapter 5 - Writing is the only thing that matters:

- Pretend that if you don't write it down (in your own words), it doesn't count
  - this is in fact almost the matter of things because
    - it forces you to think about it.
    - it gives you a purpose as to why you're reading/listening
      - hence sharpening focus
  - living by this truth will force you to:
    - learn how to discern good arguments from good sounding arguments, since you'll
      have to decide which ones to write down
    - learn efficiently, to reach the phase of 'open questions' more quickly
    - retain information by reflecting on how to synthesize it in your own words.

## Chapter 8 - Let the Work Carry You Forward

- We are hoping to achieve a dynamic in our workflow that energizes us and
  keeps us engaged. This allows us to be productive with little effort.
  - This can be achieved by ensuring that our workflow follows a _positive
    feedback_ loop, wherein we feel rewarded by the work we do, causing us to
    _want_ to do more of it, since we enjoy it.
- Positive feedback motivates us because it communicates that we are getting
  better.
- To get positive feedback though, we need to be open to feedback in general,
  the 'growth mindset'
  - This is because without negative feedback, we won't know what to improve
    on, and won't improve on it.
- The system described in this book is designed on purpose so to regularly
- provide small, high quality feedback:
  - Forcing yourself to write while you read gives you feedback on your
    understanding
  - Making permanent notes from your inbox gives you feedback on your writing
  - Making connections to existing permanent notes gives you feedback on gaps
    in your thinking, and your writing.

## Chapter 9 - Separate and Interlocking Tasks

- Writing requires focused, sustained attention, which is a limited resource
  - Multitasking sucks
    - It has been shown to reduce productivity, by reducing the quality and
      quantity of your accomplishments.
      - When you 'multitask', what you are really doing is constantly shifting
        your attention between multiple tasks, requiring extra effort, and
        essentially interrupting any attempt at _focused attention_
    - Writing is a multi-faceted process with several required tasks (e.g.
      reading, thinking, gathering insight, typing, editing, etc.)
  - Writing requires a wide gamut of types of attention. From focused, to
    exploratory, floating. This is the case for any sort of creative or scientific pursuit.
    - To be able to achieve such flexibility, one needs a flexible system that
      doesn't rely on plans or structure, such as the zettelkasten.
    - Instead, the zettelkasten provides a framework wherein through repeated
      experience, you build expertise and hence intuition to guide you.
- Like attention, our short-term memory is also limited. We can hold a maximum
  of 7 +/- 2 things in our head at the same time.
  - We can "hack" our short-term memory by bundling the "things" we need to
    remember. In a way, bundling is just another word for applying a rule,
    like remembering a formula rather than the outputs of the formula.
    - This is why it is easier to remember things that we _understand_.
      - These are things that are internally connected in our brain.
  - We can also "hack" our short-term memory by making use of the _Zeigarnik
    Effect_:
    - Open tasks occupy our short-term memory until they are done _OR_
      until they are written down in a way that convinces us that they will be
      taken care of.
    - Writing off less-important tasks/ideas for later gives space in our brain
      to focus and ruminate on more complex tasks.
      - Doing so may allow us to come up with solutions "by accident".
    - This is why thinking in writing, the principle of zettelkasten is so
      great: everything is externalized anyway, freeing your mind to focus on the
      important.
- Willpower is also a limited resource that is necessary for successful
  writing.
  - We can cheat ourselves into gaining willpower by reducing the number of decisions we
    have to make
    - This is because decision-making is one of the most tiring tasks we carry
      out throughout the day.
    - Deciding on a organizational system such as the zettelkasten allows us to
      decrease the number of decisions to make.
- Breaks are important for the brain because they allow the brain to process
  information, either by removing it or moving it into long-term memory so to
  free up space for new information in our short-term memory buffer.
