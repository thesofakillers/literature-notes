# Paul Graham - Keep Your Identity Small - February 2009

With religion and politics, people don't feel like they need to have vast
expertise to have opinions about it. This is unlike other topics.

This is because both religion and politics engage people's identity, pulling
them into emotional discussions which are, by definition, partisan. 

If reasoning fruitfully about subjects that are affected by your identity is
close to impossible, then to maximize useful reflections and idea generation,
one should aim to reduce their identity as much as possible.

Less labels, less dumb.
