# Veritasium - Is Success Luck or Hard Work? - 2020

Egocentric bias: most people think they do most of the work. Equally, most
people think they cause most of the problems.

This bias leads us to underestimate the role of luck in success.

The luck of being born in a well-developed country for example, which is
something 'successful' people rarely appreciate as instrumental to their
success.

Success isn't either down to skill or luck, it's down to both.

Interestingly, the less we believe in luck, the more likely we are to find
success - since we are more likely to work harder than those who subconsciously
rely on chance. This is also because if one is uncertain about the outcome of
a set of actions, they are less likely to invest effort in those actions. It is
a useful delusion to believe you are in full control of your destiny.

Another "benefit" to ignoring the role of luck in our everyday lives, is that it
is easier to justify your position in society; it is easier to accept
inequality. This is in a way, a form of Survivorship Bias. 

This effect is mostly pronounced in the most successful members of our society,
which are usually those who run it. They end up having a distorted view of the
world because of this, without having any inherent malice within them.

It has been found that acknowledging our own lucky circumstances not only
brings us more in alignment with reality, but also makes us more likeable.

It also makes us more happy, as it gives us a reason to be more grateful, to
experience gratitude, which is the principal ingredient for happiness.

Successful people view the world as fair, and view those less successful than
them as less talented and less hard-working. This is simply not the complete
picture, and fails to capture the role of luck in generating success and
failure.
