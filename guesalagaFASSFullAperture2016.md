## Introduction 

- The latest generation of CCDs has allowed the development of FASS, which
  utilizes the high resolution of the sensors and Fourier analysis to estimate
  scintillation and calculate astronomical seeing
  - There is also DIMM channel in the instrument, however this channel is not
    strictly necessary.
