- Procrastination means putting off things one needs to do.
- However, procrastination does not necessarily mean not doing anything at all.
- In fact, procrastination can often consist in doing less important/useful
  tasks to avoid doing more pressing ones.

- Structured procrastination is then the art of motivating a procrastinator to
  do difficult/important/laborious tasks by tasking them with even more
  challenging tasks that they will inevitably avoid.

  - by maintaining a list of tasks ranked in descending order of importance. ]
    - the procrastinator will be very motivated to do the tasks towards the
      bottom of the list, as a way to avoid the ones on the top

- The trick lies in choosing projects that seem to be important (but aren't
  really) and seem to have real/clear deadlines (but don't really) as those at
  the top of the list.

- This all depends on a good level of skill in self-deception
