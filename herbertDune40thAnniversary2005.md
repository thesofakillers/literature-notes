## General Notes 

The Universe is largely controlled by three main powers:
- the Empire
- The Landsraad which is a collective of powerful families
- the Guild which has a monopoly on interstellar transport
  - very jealous of its privacy. Guildsmen have mutated 

The sandworms of Arrakis can span more than 400 meters in length and 22 meters in diameter

Arrakis has very powerful storms. Along with the worms, this makes certain regions (northern latitudes) uninhabitable. 

Trouble is expected for the Duke's move to Arrakis, orchestrated by the Harkonnens. 

Shields attract sandworms. Like blood and sharks 

Harvester factories are giant movable factories that harvest spice. Carryalls are even larger flying vehicles used to carry and rescue harvester factories 

There is an attempted murder by a trap set up in Paul's room in their palace in Arrakeen. Paul manages to escape. 

There seems to be a connection between worms and spice. Worms protect spice sands, as try are part of their territory. A complicated chemical interchange of the worms and the spice is suspected. 

Works are composed of rings, with each ring having a life of its own and capable of regeneration

Drum sand is a sand formation where slight perturbations cause the sand to resonate/drum, attracting worms

Upon death, the liquids of a fremen corpse are recycled into water for the tribe. 

There exists an accord of some sort between Kynes and Tuek

It seems that Kynes knows of a source of water on Arrakis that would be enough to greatly improve the planet ecology, but he is concealinthid knowledge. 

Jessica is pregnant with the Duke Leto's daughter. Duke Leto still doesn't know

The Duke's men are uneasy. They do not have a home any longer and suspect that the Duke is failing. 

Yueh lures the Duke and paralyzes him. As the Duke succumbs to unconsciousness, Yueh reveals to him his plan to use the Duke as a Trojan Horse price for the Baron in exchange of Wanna. Yueh explains that he is installing a tooth in the Duke's mouth that the Duke will be able to use to release a poisonous gas to kill himself and the Baron. Yueh almost hypnotizes the Duke with regards to this tooth. He promises to keep Jessica and Paul safe by faking their death and placing them under the vigil of Fremen

Paul and Jessica are kidnapped by the Harkonnens, and sentenced to be dropped (by Yueh's suggestions) in the middle of the desert where they're likely to die. This is to avoid any direct responsibility, come the interrogation of a truthsayer. Paul and Jessica manage to kill their captors in the ornithopter upon landing in the desert. The ornithopter seemed especially picked to facilitate their survival. 

In fact we discover that Yueh purposely hid a Fremkit and the Ducal signet ring in the ornithopter before its departure with Paul and Jessica 

Meanwhile, the Baron has regained control of Arrakis and is finishing off the remaining men of Duke Leto

Upon dying, Duke Leto is left with a thought: The day the flesh shapes and the flesh the day shapes. 

The Baron survives the Duke's gas trap via his shield and Piter's gasp. 

The Sardaukar, i.e. the emperor, collaborate with the Harkonnens for the elimination of the Atreides from Arrakis. [Why did the emperor send the Atreides to Arrakis, just have them removed by the Harkonnens?](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/15057/why-did-the-emperor-send-the-atreides-to-arrakis-then-the-sardaukar-to-remove-t) To protect his power and control. Politics. Plots within plots. 

## Interesting Quotes

- "Humans are almost always lonely" p47
- "Fear is the mind-killer" p15
- "the mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience." p62
- "The person who experiences greatness must have a feeling for the myth he
  is in. He must reflect what is projected upon him. And he must have a strong sense of the sardonic. This is
  what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions. The sardonic is all that permits him to move within
  himself. Without this quality, even occasional greatness will destroy a man." p267
- "The natural human's an animal without logic." p319
