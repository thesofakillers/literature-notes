The Universe is largely controlled by three main powers:
- the Empire
- The Landsraad which is a collective of powerful families
- the Guild which has a monopoly on interstellar transport
  - very jealous of its privacy. Guildsmen have mutated 

The sandworms of Arrakis can span more than 400 meters in length and 22 meters in diameter

Arrakis has very powerful storms. Along with the worms, this makes certain regions (northern latitudes) uninhabitable. 

Trouble is expected for the Duke's move to Arrakis, orchestrated by the Harkonnens.
