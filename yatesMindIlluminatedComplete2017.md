## Chapter Notes

### Introduction

#### Meditation: The Science and Art of Living

**Meditation** has been shown to enhance concentration, improve sleep, alleviate
stress and anxiety, while also providing unique mental states characterized by
deep joy, pleasure and peace. The ultimate goal of meditation however is
**Awakening**. This is a _cognitive event_ resulting in the lasting attainment
of genuine wisdom of the true nature of reality through direct experience.

The meaning of life is not found in the things we leave behind or in what
historians have to say about us once we pass away. Rather, the beauty of life is
in the quality of our conscious experience and from the impact it can guide us
on having on others. Meditation is the art of conscious living.

Conscious living means purposely creating your reality, rather than haphazardly.
To do this, you must understand your mind _intuitively_. This only comes through
direct observation and experience.

True happiness comes from within. While pain and pleasure are inevitable,
suffering and happiness are a choice, which the fully Awake has the love, power
and wisdom to control for the better. Awakening should therefore be the aim of
your meditation.

#### A Modern Roadmap for Meditation

- Roadmaps for how to meditate certainly already exist: the Buddha presented
  what one would call a guide for meditation in a series of verses known as the
  Ānāpānasati Sutta.
  - other examples include
    - Kamalasila's _Bhāvanākrama_
    - Buddaghosa's _Visuddhimagga_
- What all meditation roadmap architects of the past seemed to realize, is
  teaching meditation in stages is a natural solution.
- These traditional guides however present some flaws:
  - they are very sparse in terms of practical details, while also often being
    quite cryptic.
  - there is "commentary noise" surrounding them due to the influences of
    different Buddhist traditions.
  - they require advanced scholarship to be translated and interpreted, advanced
    scholarship that often is not accompanied by advanced experience in the
    practice of meditation, which is _also_ necessary for interpretation.
- The roadmap in this book is was reverse engineered by the author using his
  extended experience in meditation practice, questions to his teachers, the
  ancient texts above and ample psychology and neuroscience background.
- The modern map of meditation is divided in 10 progressive Stages.
- The book is a fusion of teachings from various Buddhist traditions, while
  still remaining consistent with all of them.
- Unlike the traditional guides, designed for those already practicing
  explicitly monastic living, this guide also considers those with more typical
  lifestyles, such as having a job, a family, and a life outside of meditation.
