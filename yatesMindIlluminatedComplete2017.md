##  Chapter Notes

### Meditation: The Science and Art of Living

**Meditation** has been shown to enhance concentration, improve sleep, alleviate stress and anxiety, while also providing unique mental states characterized by deep joy, pleasure and peace. The ultimate goal of meditation however is **Awakening**. This is a _cognitive event_ resulting in the lasting attainment of genuine wisdom of the true nature of reality through direct experience. 

The meaning of life is not found in the things we leave behind or in what historians have to say about us once we pass away. Rather, the beauty of life is in the quality of our conscious experience and from the impact it can guide us on having on others. Meditation is the art of conscious living. 

Conscious living means purposely creating your reality, rather than haphazardly. To do this, you must understand your mind _intuitively_. This only comes through direct observation and experience. 

True happiness comes from within. While pain and pleasure are inevitable, suffering and happiness are a choice, which the fully Awake has the love, power and wisdom to control for the better. Awakening should therefore be the aim of your meditation.
