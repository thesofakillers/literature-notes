### Introduction

#### Meditation: The Science and Art of Living

**Meditation** has been shown to enhance concentration, improve sleep, alleviate
stress and anxiety, while also providing unique mental states characterized by
deep joy, pleasure and peace. The ultimate goal of meditation however is
**Awakening**. This is a _cognitive event_ resulting in the lasting attainment
of genuine wisdom of the true nature of reality through direct experience.

The meaning of life is not found in the things we leave behind or in what
historians have to say about us once we pass away. Rather, the beauty of life is
in the quality of our conscious experience and from the impact it can guide us
on having on others. Meditation is the art of conscious living.

Conscious living means purposely creating your reality, rather than haphazardly.
To do this, you must understand your mind _intuitively_. This only comes through
direct observation and experience.

True happiness comes from within. While pain and pleasure are inevitable,
suffering and happiness are a choice, which the fully Awake has the love, power
and wisdom to control for the better. Awakening should therefore be the aim of
your meditation.

#### A Modern Roadmap for Meditation

- Roadmaps for how to meditate certainly already exist: the Buddha presented
  what one would call a guide for meditation in a series of verses known as the
  Ānāpānasati Sutta.
  - other examples include
    - Kamalasila's _Bhāvanākrama_
    - Buddaghosa's _Visuddhimagga_
- What all meditation roadmap architects of the past seemed to realize, is
  teaching meditation in stages is a natural solution.
- These traditional guides however present some flaws:
  - they are very sparse in terms of practical details, while also often being
    quite cryptic.
  - there is "commentary noise" surrounding them due to the influences of
    different Buddhist traditions.
  - they require advanced scholarship to be translated and interpreted, advanced
    scholarship that often is not accompanied by advanced experience in the
    practice of meditation, which is _also_ necessary for interpretation.
- The roadmap in this book is was reverse engineered by the author using his
  extended experience in meditation practice, questions to his teachers, the
  ancient texts above and ample psychology and neuroscience background.
- The modern map of meditation is divided in 10 progressive Stages.
- The book is a fusion of teachings from various Buddhist traditions, while
  still remaining consistent with all of them.
- Unlike the traditional guides, designed for those already practicing
  explicitly monastic living, this guide also considers those with more typical
  lifestyles, such as having a job, a family, and a life outside of meditation.

#### Putting this Practice into Context

- Awakening is the culminating insight in a series of special insights known as
  vipassanā.
- Awakening can only occur when the mind is in the mental state of śamatha
- Both vipassanā and śamatha can be achieved using stable attention and
  mindfulness, samādhi and sati respectively.
- Both vipassanā and śamatha are necessary for Awakening.

- Śamatha is characterized by:
  - effortlessly stable attention (samādhi)
  - powerful mindfulness,
  - joy
  - tranquillity
  - equanimity: a state of psychological stability and composure which is
    undisturbed by experience of or exposure to emotions, pain, or other
    phenomena that may cause others to lose the balance of their mind.
- Typically, Śamatha begins with samadhi and mindfulness causing joy to emerge.
  This joy gradually evolves into tranquility, which then continues on to become
  equanimity.

- When we speak of vipassanā, we refer to insights into the true nature of
  reality that radically transform our understanding of ourselves and our
  relationship to the world.
- This is not to be confused with more "mundane" insights that are often
  by-products of mediation, such as better understandings of our personality,
  our social interactions, society, etc..
- vipassanā are not intellectual, but rather experiential and intuitive.
- we can achieve vipassanā by investigating phenomena (searching for truth)
  (dhamma vicaya) with persistence (viriya)
- the five most important vipassanā are insights into:
  - impermanence,
  - emptiness,
  - the nature of suffering,
  - the causal interdependence of all phenomena,
  - the illusion of the separate self
- the first four of these can be experienced using samadhi and sati.
- the fifth of these is actually the culminating insight that produces
  Awakening.

- As we can see, both samadhi and sati are necessary for samatha and vipassana.

  - emphasizing one or the other will cause an imbalance in expense of the
    other, that will lead to dead ends.

- Samatha and vipassana can occur at any time, even "prematurely", long before
  one becomes an adept practitioner.
- What this means is that the same can be said for Awakening.
  - As such, we can say that Awakening is somewhat unpredictable, almost like an
    accident.
- Awakening is an accident, but continued practice will make one accident-prone.
